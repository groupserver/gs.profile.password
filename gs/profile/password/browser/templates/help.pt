    <h3>Password Security</h3>
    <p>
      Passwords are shown in two different ways, depending on if you are
      setting a password, or using a password to log in.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you <em>set</em> a password &#8212; using either the
      <a href="#gs-profile-password-change">change password,</a>
      <a href="#gs-profile-password-reset">reset password,</a>
      <a href="#gs-profile-signup">during sign up</a> or
      when accepting your first invitation <!--TODO: Link--> &#8212;
      you will be able to see your password.
      This makes it easier to set.
      However, anyone who looks at your screen will also be able to
      see your password.
      Be cautious about who can see your screen when you set a password.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you <em>use</em> your password to
      log in<!--TODO: link--> 
      your password will be hidden: a series of <code>*</code> 
      characters will <em>mask</em> what you type.
      It is unlikely that anyone will be able to figure out your
      password by looking at your screen.
      However, be cautious about who can see your keyboard as you type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passwords must be at least four characters long. However,
      longer passwords are harder to guess.
