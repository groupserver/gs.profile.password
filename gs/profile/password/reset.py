        # --=mpj17=-- The password-reset system can be used to breach
        #   someone's privacy. First, an attacker adds the victim's
        #   address to a profile with no verified addresses, and removes
        #   all other addresses. Then the attacker can verify the
        #   address by going to the Password Reset page and filling it
        #   out. Finally the attacker joins a bunch of groups and starts
        #   spamming the victim.
        #
        #   It seems a lot of work to send a bunch of spam, but it could
        #   be automated. The solution should not be too hard: the
        #   redirector should send the reset_id to this page. If the ID
        #   is not current then the page should barf. That should solve
        #   the issue because the attacker would have to know the ID.
